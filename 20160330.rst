#######################

Today I decided to play around with python - the end goal is to port RWT to
python. The plan was to 
  1. read the .nrrd images (binary segmentations).
  2. count total labeled voxels (total lesion volume).
  3. get connected component count (lesion load)

Read the .nrrd's
================

After successfully completing the first bullet with

  pip install pynrrd

  import nrrd

Look at the 3D data
===================

Instead of going for bullet 2 I decided (*bad dog*) to *take a look* at the images.
So much time has been wasted that the main conclusions have to be documented.

If you want to do 3D visualization, google will lead you to mayavi or
matplotlib or whatever else is there. The only sane solution , that I
discovered with a popularity contest (number of downloads on pypi) is
PyQtGraph.

Just in case - results of the popularity contest:
  package | daily | weekly | monthly DL
  -------------------------------------
  pyvtk   | 47    | 432    | 2039
  vispy   | 20    | 243    | 817
  glumpy  | 23    | 143    | 661
  mayavi  | 108   | 432    | 2039
  pyqtgraph | 154 | 977    | 8704
  -------------------------------------


It was the only one of those (tried each) that I was able to get 3D graphs
from under python3 and virtualenv. No wonder it's most downloaded, dunno how
those other packages got so high in google.
